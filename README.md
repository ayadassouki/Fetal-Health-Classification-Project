# Fetal-Health-Classification-Project
This repository hosts a data science project aimed at classifying fetal health into Normal, Suspect, and Pathological categories using the Fetal Health Classification dataset from Kaggle. By analyzing Cardiotocogram exam features through machine learning, we develop models for accurate fetal health predictions.
