# Fetal-Health-Classification-Project
This repository hosts a data science project aimed at classifying fetal health into Normal, Suspect, and Pathological categories using the Fetal Health Classification dataset from Kaggle. By analyzing Cardiotocogram exam features through machine learning, we develop models for accurate fetal health predictions.

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify fetal health in order to prevent child and maternal mortality, using the dataset provided by Kaggle's Fetal Health Classification challenge. The dataset allows for the exploration and modeling of fetal health based on features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams, which represent the fetal heart rate and uterine contraction metrics over time.

## Dataset
The dataset includes features like baseline heart rate, accelerations, fetal movement, uterine contractions, and several others that were measured during these exams. Our goal is to apply machine learning techniques to predict fetal health status, classified into three categories: Normal, Suspect, and Pathological.

## How to Use
### Prerequisites
. Python 3.x
. Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
. Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Results
### Feature Importance: 
 Analysis revealed that features such as baseline fetal heart rate, accelerations, and decelerations were among the most significant predictors of fetal health status. This insight aligns with medical understanding and highlights areas for further research and monitoring in prenatal care.
